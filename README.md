# AntParlor

ABSTRACT:

Ant Parlor is an application that helps people find any beauty or cosmetic need from haircuts to pedicures - literally head to toe. The difference in using our app as opposed to googling a barber shop or salon is that we have individual barbers, stylists, manicurists, and makeup artists  that are willing to either come to your house or set up an appointment at their own home or salon, all in one web application. Versus the traditional method of googling, then calling individual shops to see if anyone has an appointment any time soon.
